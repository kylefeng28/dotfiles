## LethargicVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) but with the principle of least surprises in mind when coming from vim.

This allows using LazyVim's powerful LSP plugins easily without needing to set them up, while disabling some of the fancier IDE settings such as autosave and [noice](https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim) in favor of the default vim behaviors.
